1. This code contains implementation of Multi-Paxos Protocol as described 
in the paper "Paxos Made Simple" by Leslie Lamport

2. The implementation is for simulated network where clients and servers are 
just separate go routines inside one process, and communicate using RPCs 
implemented over unix sockets. Also, the implementation has been tested 
throughly against a comprehensive test suite adapted from MIT 6.824 course.

3. Note, that there is no main function. Instead, all the initilization is 
	done through the tester code.

4. To run 
	 export GOPATH=[pathprefix]/Paxos_Lab/
	a) paxos peer: 
		cd paxos  
		go test
	b) paxos peer along with key-value server
	   cd paxos_kv
	   go test
	c) paxos profile
		cd paxos_profiler
		go build paxos_profiler.go
		./paxos_profiler

5. Tests are in paxos/test_test.go and paxos_kv/test_test.go

6. Folder Structure
   	/paxos_kv - contains code for key-value server and clients(application code)
   	/paxos - contains code for paxos peer
	/paxos_profiler - contains code profiling paxos based key-value service

7. To turn on debugging 
	For paxos peer set Debug flag in paxos/util.go
	For key-value server/client in paxos_kv/server.go
